# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to show decision makers at PyBer the differences between the total weekly fares for each city type. This is done by creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, then creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

Looking at the "Total Fare by City Type" chart, we can see that the city type that has the lowest fares total is Rural, followed by Suburban then having Urban leading with the highest fare total.

### Statistics for each city type
#### Urban
- Racking in almost $20,000 more than Suburban, the total fares for Urban is $39,854.38
- The total rides are 1,625 and total drivers is 2,405
- The average fare per ride is $24.53 and average fare per driver is $16.57, coming in lower than that of Suburban and Rural

#### Suburban
- Coming in second to Urban, Suburban racked up $19,356.33 in total fares
- The total rides are 625 and total drivers at 490, almost six times more than that of Rural rides and drivers
- The average fare per ride is $30.97 and average fare per driver is $39.50

#### Rural
- With the lowest of all three, Rurals' total fares came up to $4,327.93
- The total rides are 125 and total drivers is 78
- Being the most expensive of all three, the average fare ride is $34.62 and average fare per driver is $55.59

The chart above gives us a better insight into each city type's statistics. We can see that rural has the lowest amount of drivers while also having the highest average fare per ride. They also have the lowest amount of rides, which might have something to do with the fact that there's a low amount of drivers. 

The reason why Urbans' average fare per ride is lower is because there is an abundance of drivers there, saturating the area, meaning there's more drivers for customers to choose from. These things also skew the average fare per driver, since there's less drivers in the Rural cities, their fare is more expensive since they are harder to come across.

## Summary 
To address the disparities among the city types, these things can be done:

1) Increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas. The lack of drivers is causing the fare price to increase, making it less accessible to certain groups of customers.

2) The amount of drivers in the Suburban areas should also be increased for the same reason as the Rural areas. Even though they have more drivers and cheaper fare prices than Rural areas, increasing the amount of drivers will allow business to increase, as it has in Urban areas.

3) Although their total fares are the highest, the Urban area has too many drivers for the amount of total rides they have. The total rides to total drivers' ratio for Rural and Suburban areas is good, but the ratio for the Urban area is off. There isn't a high enough demand for rides for there to be that many drivers in that area.
